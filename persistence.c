/** Unique prefixes which do not contain 7, 8, or 9
 *
 * Given any number, we shrink it as far as possible by combining digits so
 * as to get 7s, 8s, and 8s on the right-hand side and one of the six unique
 * prefixes below on the left-hand side.  For instance, given the number
 * 7236, we can split the digits it into primes and re-combine and get 479
 * which is the smallest number whose digets multiply to the same value as
 * 7236.  Using this scheme, and reforming all numbers as <prefix>777888999
 * where the number of 7s, 8s, and 8s varies, we can get all unique products
 * of digits with the smallest possible number.  This also gives us a very
 * nice way to generate them.  I cannot take credit for this; it was Matt
 * Parker's idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ
 *
 * When we do this reduction, we are left with six unique prefixes that can
 * end up at the front of the 7s, 8s, and 9s which I have in the list below
 * sorted smallest to largest.  Even though 26 looks like the largest, the
 * next 2-digit number will be a 2 followed by something that's at least a
 * 7 so it really does make sense.
 *
 * I've left 5 in the list but commented it out because once you have a 5,
 * you will always have a 5 and the moment you have both a 5 and an even
 * number, you hit a multiple of 10 which then goes to 0.  Therefore, while
 * it's theoretically possible that a persistent number exists which contains
 * a 5, I've considered it so incredibly unlikely as to not be worth even
 * bothering to search.  Searching all numbers up to 100 digits, cutting out
 * the 5 cases saves about 10% of the runtime.
